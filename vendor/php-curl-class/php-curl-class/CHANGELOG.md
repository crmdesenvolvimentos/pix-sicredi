# Change Log

PHP Curl Class uses semantic versioning with version numbers written as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. You may safely update
`MINOR` and `PATCH` version changes. It is recommended to review `MAJOR` changes prior to upgrade as there may be
backwards-incompatible changes that will affect existing usage.

the `MAJOR` upgrade from 7.4.0 to 8.0.0. Comparing against `HEAD` is also possible using the `tag...HEAD` syntax
([8.3.0...HEAD](https://github.com/php-curl-class/php-curl-class/compare/8.3.0...HEAD)).
